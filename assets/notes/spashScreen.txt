You can change the screen that appears when a Flutter app is opened by modifying the SplashScreen or Splash Screen class that is typically used to handle the splash screen functionality. You can customize the splash screen by changing the background color, image, animation, and other elements, as well as the duration that the screen is displayed.

You can also use package:flutter_splash_screen package to customize your splash screen.
You can add it to your pubspec.yaml file and import it in your main.dart file.
Then you can use the FlutterSplashScreen.hide() method to hide the splash screen when the app is ready.

Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter_splash_screen: ^1.2.0
Copy code
import 'package:flutter_splash_screen/flutter_splash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
  FlutterSplashScreen.hide();
}
You can also use the FlutterSplashScreen.setBackgroundColor() method to change the background color of the splash screen.

Copy code
FlutterSplashScreen.setBackgroundColor(Colors.white);
You can also use the FlutterSplashScreen.setSplashScreen method to set a custom splash screen.

Copy code
FlutterSplashScreen.setSplashScreen(
    Image.asset('assets/splash.png'),
    backgroundColor: Colors.white,
    duration: 2500,
    loaderColor: Colors.red);
Note that you need to add the image in your assets folder and include it in your pubspec.yaml file.

Copy code
assets:
    - assets/splash.png
There are other packages you can use as well like splashy or splashscreen as well.
