Write a complete flutter code that displays a google map and automatically detects the device's location and marks it with a bitmap hue red location pin marker. A destination location which is to later be provided by the user from another screen should also be shown with a bitmap hue blue location pin marker when typed on a textformfield.And while the device's current location is still being accessed or null, display a centered circular progress indicator with 'loading' text below it. Once the user provides the destination add a polyline that routes between the device's location and the destination location entered.
